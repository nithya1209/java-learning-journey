# Day 01 – Java Fundamentals

## 1. Java History
Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.
It was designed to be platform-independent and object-oriented.
Later, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle, which now maintains Java.

## 2. What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a formal language used to communicate instructions
to a computer in order to perform specific tasks and solve problems.

## 3. Types of Programming Languages

### 3.1 Procedural Programming Language
Focuses on procedures or functions.
Example: C

### 3.2 Object-Oriented Programming Language
Focuses on objects and classes.
Example: Java

### 3.3 Functional Programming Language
Focuses on functions and immutability.
Example: Haskell

### 3.4 Scripting Language
Used for automation and scripting.
Example: Python

## 4. Java Boilerplate Code

### Static Boilerplate
In Java, program execution starts from the `main` method which must be static.
This allows the JVM to call the method without creating an object.
 
public static void main(String[] args)
First Java Program : 

o class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.

o public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is
visible to all.

o static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static
method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create
an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM,
so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves
memory.

o void is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.

o main represents the starting point of the program.

o String[] args or String args[] is used for command line argument.

o System.out.println() is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an
object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class
